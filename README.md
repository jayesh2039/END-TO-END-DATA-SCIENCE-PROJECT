# Live Demo: https://house-price-predictor-2-inji.onrender.com

This is a simple end-to-end data science project that predicts house prices based on features like number of rooms, garage cars, and living area.

Built using:
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Flask 🌐
- HTML (for UI)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Model training using Linear Regression
- CSV dataset preprocessing
- Prediction via web form (UI)
- Flask-based API with HTML frontend
- Clean, single-file implementation
